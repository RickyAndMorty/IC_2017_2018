Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an extensive scientific discipline with enables computer systems to solve problems by emulating complex biological proccess such as learning, reasoning and self-correction. A stride forward towards making agents more intelligent comes by incorporating the use of knowledge, reasoning and planning. In this case, intelligent agents keep a knowledge base where relevant knowledge about the environment and about the impact of their actions is stored [1].

The goal of this work is to minimize the interferece between the users of a optical network, and maximize the energy efficiency, considering the quality of service (QoS) restrictions in terms of signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) of each optical user class[2]. Using the algorithm of optimization, knowing as PSO, which means Particle Swarm Optimization. 

The PSO is based on thei moviment of a population (swarm) of individuals (particles) randomily distributed in the search space, each one with its own position and velocity [2].
